Although Pickler did not make a public statement after her husband’s death, the couple openly expressed their love and shared a personal and professional relationship.</p><p>They collaborated on songwriting and USO tours, and even starred in a reality show together for three seasons. However, their marriage was their priority, and Jacobs stated in 2015 that their relationship will always come first, above their careers or other occupations.</p><p>“Whatever the job is, if it ever gets in the way of our marriage, then it gets in the way,” Jacobs said back in 2015. “Our marriage comes first.” “We love that our marriage is number one, it will always be number one. But one of our favorite things to do is laugh. And we want to show that to people,” he said.</p><p>Disclaimer: The above information is for general information purposes only.
