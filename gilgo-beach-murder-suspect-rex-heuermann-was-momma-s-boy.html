“Psycho.”</p><p>Accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann was bizarrely close to his “controlling” mother while he was an adolescent, according to sources.</p><p>Heuermann, 59, was a “momma’s boy” and would tell friends “things like, ‘I have to get home to my mother,’ ” said a <a href=#>former classmate who attended Berner High School in Massapequa</a> with the suspect.</p><p>“I always got the impression he was close . . . to his mother. The mother seemed to be his all,” the former classmate said of Dolores Heuermann, now 93.&nbsp;</p><p>The extremely close ties between the pair may have influenced Heuermann’s decision to <a href=#>buy his childhood home in Massapequa Park</a> from his mom for $170,000 in 1994 — shortly after his first marriage, to Elizabeth Ryan in 1990, failed.</p><p>He never left.</p><p>Heuermann — who pleaded not guilty on July 14 to <a href=#>murder charges in connection with the deaths of sex workers</a> Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Amber Lynn Costello, 22, and Megan Waterman, 27 — found himself the man of that house at the young age of 12.</p><p>His father, Theodore Heuermann, who served in World War II and in the Air Force as a second lieutenant, died in 1975 at the age of 50.</p><p>The younger Heuermann, who founded his own architecture firm, RH Consultants & Associates in 1994, curiously never spoke about his late father around his friends, the classmate recalled.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Heuermann came across as a “momma’s boy” to former Berner High School classmates when he was a teen. <span class=credit>ZUMAPRESS.com</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Heuermann’s relationship with his mother may have influenced his decision to purchase his childhood home from her. <span class=credit>Dennis A.
