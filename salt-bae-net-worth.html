He also owns a chain of Turkish steakhouses.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Nusret Gökçe is, as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Gökçe’s wealth is as high as $300,000, an amount earned through his successful career in the food industry, active since the 2000s.</p><h3>Salt Bae Net Worth $300,000</h3><p>Of Kurdish ancestry, Nusret grew up in poverty and began working when he was only 14 years old. He started as a dishwasher in a local restaurant, as it was as close as he could get to be active in his love for food preparation, which had already surfaced when he was still in his early years. Nusret worked hard at absorbing greatly needed knowledge that would help him considerably in his further career. As he had to work from an early age, he didn’t have any time or money for formal education, however, that didn’t stop him from becoming a successful chef in his own country, and later internationally.</p><p>Never backing down from his dream of opening his own restaurant, Salt Bae managed to fulfill his dream when he was 27 years old. Though it was a small restaurant that contained only eight tables, he had 10 people working for him. Wanting to learn more in order to become the best chef he could be, he traveled the world visiting restaurants and even wanted to go to the USA, but he was denied the visa needed to get into the country. However, things got better for Nusret, and he was eventually granted a visa to the US.</p><p>After returning to his home country, Nusret began expanding his little kingdom, opening other restaurants in Turkey firstly, and then in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, while he also aspires to open restaurants in London and New York City. His restaurant chain is named Nusr-Et, with “Et” meaning meat in the Turkish language. His success increased his net worth to a large degree, however, he remained unknown internationally until early 2017, but things changed for the better for Nurset when he posted a video on Instagram, while he was preparing a steak for one of his customers, spreading salt onto his forearm and then rubbing it into the meat, which became quite popular with the public, not only in Turkey but across the world, earning him the nickname Salt Bae. He has now built a following of over a million subscribers to his Instagram site in a very short period of time, and more than seven million views of THAT video.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Nurset tends to keep his most intimate details hidden from the public eye, however, the assumption is that he is married, as he is known to have nine children!</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqyYpaxdl66mec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./selena-gomez-shares-sexy-throwback-photo-in-strapless-bustier-maybe-it-s-too-much.html>&#171;&nbsp;Selena Gomez Shares Sexy Throwback Photo In Strapless Bustier: Maybe Its Too Much</a>
