After dating for one and a half years, Albert <a href=#>decided to propose</a> her with a cushion-cut eternity band pattern of a diamond ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572517425388.jpg><p>Albert later surprisingly proposed her on the Christmas Eve on&nbsp;<i>18th December 2013</i>. She was so amazed by the proposal and said that she could wear the ring for her whole life and accepted his proposal and became united as husband and wife but yet to share kids as of now.</p><h2>Niemi & Patrick Swayze's Love Story</h2><p><i>One Last Dance</i>&nbsp;writer, Liesa, was married to her first beloved husband,&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Swayze</strong>, an American actor on&nbsp;<i>12th June 1975</i>. After their wedding ceremony, they settled down to New York City to follow their dancing careers in the late&nbsp;<i>1970s</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572517558867.jpg><p>The perfect soulmates found their true love at the Houston Ballet Dance Company, where Niemi met Patrick, who was the owner and director of the institute. At that time, they both were only 14 years old. When they reached the age of 15, they eventually started dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572517604045.jpg><p>The married pair relocated from New York to Los Angeles, California, where they ran different businesses and raised horses to pursue in the field of acting as well as dancing. Unfortunately, Niemi suffered a miscarriage in the early&nbsp;<i>1990s</i>, and since then, they had no kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572517723389.jpg><p>After the incident, Swayze started taking alcohol and became addicted to alcoholism. Later, Niemi decided to admit Patrick into rehab treatment. After the first recovery, he partially withdrew from his show businesses, to go out for taking care of his Arabian horses, including his favorite horse,&nbsp;<strong>Tammen</strong>, a chestnut Arabian stallion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572517861806.jpg><p>During a flight from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico, Swayze started to demand alcohol, but there were no hard drinks in the cabin. Patrick, however, found out that the juice is stored in external storage compartments, which are restricted in flight. He refused the flight services and started drinking alcohol.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572517991006.jpg><p>The probable cause of the alcohol made Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine consumed by-product, which was from heavy tobacco and an undetermined amount of cabin compression, resulting in hypoxia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/10/31/Capture-1572518094541.jpg><p>Later, Patrick was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, but Niemi was the one who helped his battle against cancer.
