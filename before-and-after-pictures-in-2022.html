She has also developed a healthier attitude on how to approach weight loss. Fans look for Jenna Bush Hager's transformation update in 2022 with before and after pictures, images, and photos. Let's find out her diet and how much weight she lost.</strong></p><p><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong> is an American <strong><a href=#>news personality</a></strong>, author, and journalist who currently co-hosts Today with Hoda & Jenna, which is the fourth hour of <strong><a href=#>NBC</a></strong>'s morning news program Today.</p><p>Before Today, she was mostly known only because of her family association. Jenna Bush Hager is one of the daughters of the 43rd US President <strong>George W. Bush</strong> and former First Lady <strong>Laura Bush</strong>. Only after her father's presidency did she start to make her own name. She became an editor-at-large for Southern Living magazine and an author.</p><p>In 2009, Jenna Bush Hager began working for NBC as a correspondent and later on, went on to be featured prominently as a member of The Today Show as a contributor, correspondent, and co-host, which cemented her popularity.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <strong><a href=#>weight loss</a></strong> stories of <strong><a href=#>Emily Engstler</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Jen Psaki</a></strong>.</p><h2>Jenna Bush Hager's Weight Loss: What's the Story?</h2><p><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jennabhager</a>) once, along with <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong>, unwittingly ended up inspiring a lot of weight-shamed women across the internet by normalizing talking about weight in public spaces when they stepped on the scale during a live taping of Today with Hoda and Jenna and revealed their <a href=# rel=noopener>weights</a> to millions of viewers.</p><p>They did it as a part of their experiment with <a href=# rel=noopener>intermittent fasting</a>. As the scale showed a figure of 171 pounds for Jenna Bush Hager, she was not happy about her weight and explained that such big figures are why she doesn't really weigh herself.</p><p>She didn't like that she weighs twice as much as her twin sister. In comparison, two of her sister could fit in her, which was not a welcome thought.</p><p>As it turns out, Jenna Bush Hager did not have an easy history with her weight. After she weighed herself, she found herself slipping back in time. She shared that she was <a href=# rel=noopener>transported</a> back to the time when she was a chubby little girl.</p><p>She had found a scale in her mother's room and weighed herself. And just like how she was not happy in the present about her weight, she had not liked what she saw on the weight scale even then when she was too little to be caring about things like her weight. Even then, she, for a moment, just got stuck there.</p><p>Those were also the times when Jenna Bush Hager used to be asked to jump on 'the blob' float at summer camp since she was heavier and made the kids on the other end of it fly higher. These seemingly little things, she sensitively took to her heart and never made much progress on recovering from it.</p><p>Jenna revealed that this was the first time she was weighing herself since college, which was almost 20 years ago. She was surprised and didn't like what she saw. She was 37 and three months postpartum then. It was November 2019.</p><p>Now, after about two years, things seemed to have slightly changed in the weight department for Jenna. Her appearance was brought into sharper focus when she was talking about her new year's resolutions on the morning show and Kotb commended her on her looks and told her that the viewers have been writing to say how great Jenna looks.</p><p>Jenna Bush Hager then explained that looking that way had taken effort and getting in shape had been a process for her. She shared her weight loss journey on the show.</p><p>She went on to detail her <a href=# rel=noopener>workout routine</a>. She had begun waking up and then working out before the show with her personal trainer <strong>Amanda</strong>. <strong>Donna Farizan</strong>, a Today contributor also joined her sometimes.</p><p>Donna, in particular, had been a source of great inspiration for Jenna Bush Hager throughout the process of weight loss. She literally got up at the crack of dawn and met her to work out, which most likely made <a href=# rel=noopener>losing weight</a> seem like a less daunting task.</p><p>Those grueling early morning workouts under the supervision of a personal trainer and along with Donna saw her through weight loss and transformed her. She also had a change of attitude about the whole weight thing.</p><p>Earlier, Jenna Bush Hager used to be hard on herself and too self-critical as well. With time, she has learned to be open-minded. She encouraged other people who are struggling with their weight to be kinder to themselves and have a little patience because weight loss takes time.</p><p>She has realized that the hardest thing about being on a weight loss journey and going through with it is that people really expect things to happen overnight. People start looking for results after work of just a few days, which is going to disappoint them and discourage them. For Jenna Bush Hager, it took almost six months.</p><p>Jenna also addressed people who have gained weight during the pandemic, and who have had babies and then gained weight and advised them to give a little grace to their bodies because it takes time, and remember that their bodies are not 18 anymore.</p><p>The mother of three was reminded by her mother former First Lady <strong>Laura Bush</strong> that post-baby, it takes two years to get back in shape.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGihnqaelnqjwdKhZKGZl5q%2FbsPEop6hrF2hvLS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./clare-stone.html>&#171;&nbsp;Clare Stone</a>
