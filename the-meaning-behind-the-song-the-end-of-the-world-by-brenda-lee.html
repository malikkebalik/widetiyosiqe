Kent was a Canadian songwriter, while Dee was an American lyricist. They had previously worked together on several other songs, including “I Left My Heart in the Balcony” and “Don’t Go to Strangers.” However, “The End of the World” would go on to be their biggest hit.</p><p>According to Kent, the inspiration for the song came from a phrase that Dee had heard on a television program. The phrase was “It’s the end of the world as we know it,” and it had been used in reference to a political crisis happening at the time. Dee thought the phrase would make a great song title and suggested it to Kent. Together, they wrote the lyrics and melody for the song.</p><p>Initially, the song was recorded by American country singer Skeeter Davis. However, the song didn’t take off until Brenda Lee released her version. Lee’s version was more upbeat and had a pop sound, which appealed to a wider audience. The song went on to become a massive hit, reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and topping the charts in several other countries.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQs></span>FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_What_is_the_meaning_behind_%E2%80%9CThe_End_of_the_World%E2%80%9D></span>1.
