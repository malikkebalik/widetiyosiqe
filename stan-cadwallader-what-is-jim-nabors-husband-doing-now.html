He is 74 years old right now. The celebrity husband spent the majority of his upbringing in Michigan. Stan, also, graduated from Petoskey High School in Petoskey, Michigan.</p><p>Stanley, on the other hand, later in life decided to relocate to the island state of Hawaii. Surprisingly, Stan met his future husband in the same condition.</p><p>Stan is also of English-Welsh heritage and of Caucasian ethnicity. Furthermore, he is an American citizen.</p><p>When it comes to his family, there is no information available. Given that he was born in Michigan, it is likely that his family members still reside there.<br>Before meeting Jim, Stan worked as a firefighter and lived on a yacht.</p><p>Stanley worked with the Honolulu fire department before meeting his late husband Jim. Stan had relocated to Honolulu after completing his official education in Michigan.</p><p>He was living in a boat at the time, and he was still living in the same boat when he and Nabors met. His love of the water appears to have motivated his decision to relocate to the small Pacific island, and to top it all off, he was sleeping in a boat.</p><p>Everything worked out in the end for Stanley since his future husband fell in love with Hawaii and relocated there permanently.</p><h2><span id=Stan_Cadwallader_is_a_commercial_pilot>Stan Cadwallader is a commercial pilot.</span></h2><p>In the 1970s, Jim was appointed as an honorary naval pilot with the United States Navy’s 28th battalion. Nonetheless, his joining the Navy was like to becoming a Naval cadet without learning how to manage a ship. He lacked a pilot’s license. Fortunately, his colleague Stan had.</p><p>Stan obtained his commercial pilot’s license in 1978. Cadwallader and his husband Jim used to fly over the island of Hawaii with their herd of dogs. The family would frequently visit their farm in Hana.<br>Stan Cadwallader met his late husband Jim Nabors in what way and when?</p><p>Your birthday is frequently regarded as the luckiest day of the year, out of all the days in a year. Similarly, one of Jim’s birthdays turned out to be his favorite. He and Stan initially meet in July 1975, on the occasion of his 45th birthday.</p><p>Jim was at the Ala Moana Shopping Center at the time. Stan happened to be in the same store at the time, and after noticing Jim, who had become rather popular by then, Stan approached him for a discussion.</p><p>The two hit it off, and because Jim was carrying a beautiful bottle of Dom Perignon, they decided to eat that night. As the night progressed, the duo realized they had a lot in common.</p><p>They stayed a pair since that day before pushing their relationship to the next level.</p><h2><span id=They_married_after_38_years_of_dating>They married after 38 years of dating.</span></h2><p>Jim and Stan eventually married after being together for over four decades. They married on January 15th, 2013. The elegant ceremony took place at Seattle’s Fairmont Olympic Hotel.</p><p>A number of their mutual acquaintances are present to witness the event. It took a few days for the news of their marriage to spread. Furthermore, their wedding takes place a month after the state of Washington recognized gay marriage.</p><p>Even though Jim disliked weddings, he wanted them to be publicly acknowledged.</p><h2><span id=Jim_Nabors_never_formally_declared_himself_gay>Jim Nabors never formally declared himself gay.</span></h2><p>Jim never really talked about his sexual orientation from the start of his profession. We all know that the industry, and indeed the entire country, was unfamiliar with gay relationships during his time.</p><p>Jim’s decision not to discuss his sexuality, on the other hand, was unusual. “I’m not a debater,” he said in a 2013 interview with Hawaii News Now. And everyone has an opinion on this, and I’m not an activist, so I’ve never been involved in any of this.”</p><p>He went on to say, “I’m 82 and he’s in his 60s, so we’ve been together for 38 years and I’m not ashamed of people knowing, it’s just that it was such a personal thing, I didn’t tell anybody.”</p><p>Furthermore, many of Jim’s close pals were already aware of his sexual orientation from the start.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_Stan_Cadwallader_Is_He_still_alive_and_well>What happened to Stan Cadwallader? Is He still alive and well?</span></h2><p>Stan has kept a low profile since Jim died away in November 2017. Even though he was married to Jim, he never showed himself in public.</p><p>The couple had been living in O’ahu, Hawaii, prior to Jim’s death. However, after his death in 2018, his estate was auctioned for a whopping $12 million. Furthermore, Jim’s enormous Maui estate was advertised for sale in 2019 for a stunning $5 million.</p><p>Stan appears to have opted to spend the rest of his life somewhere tranquil. Despite the fact that there hasn’t been any news of him since 2017, it’s safe to say he’s doing well.</p><p>In terms of his partner’s death, Nabors died on November 30, 2017. He died at the age of 87 at his residence in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p><h2><span id=What_Was_Stan_Cadwallader8217s_net_worth>What Was Stan Cadwallader’s net worth?</span></h2><p>Being a famous spouse allows you to live a luxury lifestyle. Similarly, Stan and his late husband Jim Nabors had a prosperous existence. The couple spent the majority of their romance in Hawaii.</p><p>Jim’s net worth was estimated to be more than $38 million at the time of his death. The majority of his money must have been passed down to Stan after his death, however this cannot be proved.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
