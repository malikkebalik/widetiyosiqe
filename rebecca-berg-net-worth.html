He is best known as a political journalist who has worked on programs such as Real Clear News and prominent channels like CNN and Fox News.</p><p>So just how rich is Rebecca Berg as of late 2017? According to authoritative sources, this American journalist has net worth of over $300,000, accumulated from her five years-long career in the previously mentioned fields.</p><h3>Rebecca Berg Net Worth $300,000</h3><p>Speaking about Rebecca’s early life, she was raised in San Diego by her father, a city planner who later on worked at a real estate brokerage, established by his wife Kris. Rebecca attended the University of Missouri, Columbia, graduating in 2011 with a double degree – a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and also a Bachelor of Journalism. During her college days, she worked as an intern at St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and additionally at the New Yorker. As she was obviously interested in politics and journalism, she pursued her career in that direction. One of Berg’s first jobs was at The New York Times, where she served as a political reporting fellow, starting her job in June 2012. However, in September of the same year, Rebecca began working on other projects including for the Washington Examiner, where she was a Capitol Hill reporter and political correspondent, and she was also working for Buzzfeed, one of the more influential websites focused on entertainment and news. Her net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>She remained there until 2015, and then joined Real Clear Politics, where she works in the position of a national political reporter as of today, and she covered stories about the US presidential election among many others. Besides that, she has enlarged her resume by working as a political analyst for CNN, one of the world’s most prominent networks, and for other notable networks including Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, and C-SPAN.</p><p>Speaking of television series she has appeared in, that list includes ‘’Fox and Friends’’, on which she began working in 2014, focused of providing the audience with the latest news headlines, political analysis and other topics. Berg left ‘’Fox and Friends’’ in 2015, and began working on ‘’Hannity’’ the program led by <a href=#>Sean Hannity</a> and broadcast on Fox News. In 2016, Rebecca was an addition to ‘’Cashin’ In’’, an American business analysis program hosted by <a href=#>Eric Bolling</a> on Fox News as well. Her net worth continues to rise.</p><p>In her private life, Berg stated that there were two catalysts for her career in journalism: the events of 11 September, when the Twin Towers were destroyed in terrorist attacks, and besides that, the 2008 presidential elections. When it comes to her love life, Berg is dating Brendan Buck, a Washington D.C.-based a chief communications advisor who is apparently her husband-to-be. Speaking about other aspects of her private life, Rebecca is active on social media websites such as Instagram and Twitter, and her account is followed by 6,470 people on the former and more than 51,000 people on the latter.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqucm52TmK5ursSrnmamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./richard-karn-age-bio-family-career-net-worth-measurements.html>&#171;&nbsp;Richard Karn Age, Bio, Family, Career, Net Worth, Measurements</a>
