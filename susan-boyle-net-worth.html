I want to raise awareness – I want to turn my disability into ability.”&nbsp;<strong>– Susan Boyle</strong></p><p>“Asperger’s doesn’t define me. It’s a condition that I have to live with and work through, but I feel more relaxed about myself. People will have a greater understanding of who I am and why I do the things I do.”&nbsp;<strong>– Susan Boyle</strong></p><p>“It was my Mum who got me into singing properly – she knew I had to do something with my voice because she knew I was talented. She was the one who pushed me into joining a choir all those years ago when I was about 12. I remember she told me to start with the choir and just see where it took me.”&nbsp;<strong>– Susan Boyle</strong></p><p>“Grownups always tell you that “sticks and stones will break your bones, but words will never hurt you.” They say it as if it’s a kind of spell that’s going to protect you. I’ve never seen the logic of it. Cuts and bruises quickly disappear. You forget all about them. The psychological wounds inflicted by bullies with words go much deeper.”&nbsp;<strong>– Susan Boyle</strong></p><p>“I live myself with my cat Pebbles. She isn’t enjoying the attention as much as me – she ran off up the stairs as soon as the film crew for the show came into the house. She didn’t come down for hours.
