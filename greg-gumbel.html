There he attended a Catholic school called the De La Salle Institute. As a student at the institute, he was actively involved in sports. In particular, the oldest Gumbel was interested in baseball.</p><p>After graduating from high school, he attended Loras University in Iowa, where he played baseball.

The former baseball player did quite well in the audition, and the TV station eventually offered him the job. Furthermore, he worked there for seven years before working at other prominent networks. The TV host has worked at MSG, ESPN, and in a radio station operated by Entercom, WFAN. Moreover, he was an announcer in SportsCenter and play-by-play commentator in early NBA games. Likewise, he was also a backup announcer for New York Knicks broadcasts and host of pregame and postgame shows for New York Yankees.</p><p>Thereafter in 1988, he started his CBS journey as a part-time NFL announcer. Then, gradually the broadcaster started announcing college basketball and The NFL Today show with former football player turned broadcaster Terry Bradshaw.</p><p>Moreover, he covered MLB, college football, and NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500. Above all, the host was also a play-by-play announcer for NBA, MLB, American League Championship Series, and College World Series baseball.

Then, during the 2004 NFL season, he took over as the host of The NFL Today, trading places with announcer Jim Natz. However, after the 2005 season, he was replaced by sportscaster James Brown. Brown is not an unfamiliar face in CBS and The NFL Today. He has worked with famous players and broadcasters like Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Jimmy Jhonson.</p><p>Following the replacement, he became the #2 play-by-play man after returning to broadcasting. Furthermore, since 2014, the former baseball player also served in the #3 team. For the 2018 NFL season, he worked in a three-man booth with Green and Bruce Arians.
