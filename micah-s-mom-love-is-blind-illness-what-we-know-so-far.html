Micah, a 27-year-old marketing manager from Seattle, was paired with Paul Peden, a 29-year-old software engineer from Atlanta. The couple had a strong connection in the pods, but faced some challenges in the real world, especially when it came to their families and friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is Micah’s mom’s illness?</strong></h2><p>Micah’s mom, Patrisha Lussier, has been a source of support and inspiration for her daughter throughout the show. However, she also has a serious health condition that has not been fully explained on the show. According to Distractify<a href=# rel=noopener>1</a>, Micah’s mom has battled cancer in the past, and some Reddit users<a href=# rel=noopener>2</a> speculate that she may have suffered a stroke as well. However, the exact nature and stage of her illness have not been disclosed by Micah or her mom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How did Micah’s mom’s illness affect her relationship with Paul?</strong></h2><p>One of the most emotional moments on the show was when Micah and her mom went wedding dress shopping together. Micah revealed that she and her mom had always prayed that she would be able to see her get married and have children despite her health issues. Micah and her mom tearfully embraced after she chose her wedding dress, and her mom expressed how happy and proud she was of her daughter. Micah’s co-stars and friends were also moved by the heartfelt moment.</p><p>However, not everything was smooth sailing for Micah and Paul. Paul’s mom, Elizabeth, had some reservations about their relationship, especially after meeting Micah’s parents, who are divorced. Elizabeth also seemed to have a closer bond with Micah than with Paul, which raised some eyebrows among the fans. Despite Paul rejecting Micah at the altar, Elizabeth still kept in touch with Micah and even invited her to stay with her in Atlanta. Some fans found this relationship “off-putting” and “weird”, while others thought it was sweet and supportive.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is the current status of Micah and her mom?</strong></h2><p>Micah and her mom seem to have a strong and loving relationship, despite the challenges they have faced. Micah often posts pictures and videos of her mom on her Instagram account<a href=# rel=noopener>3</a>, where she has over 300k followers. She also thanks her mom for being her best friend and role model. In one of her recent posts, she wrote: “Happy Mother’s Day to my beautiful mama! You are my rock, my inspiration, my everything. I love you more than words can say.”</p><p>As for her mom’s health, there is no clear update on how she is doing at the moment. However, based on Micah’s posts, it seems that she is still fighting and staying positive. In April 2023, Micah shared a video of her mom dancing with her dad at a family gathering, and captioned it: “My parents are goals! So happy to see my mom feeling good and having fun.” She also added the hashtags #cancersucks and #fuckcancer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Micah’s mom love is blind illness is one of the mysteries that has intrigued the fans of the show. While we don’t know much about her condition, we do know that she is a loving and supportive mother who has been there for her daughter through thick and thin. We hope that she continues to recover and enjoy life with her family and friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JforakrcesZKannWK5sMLEZqCsZZKhtq%2BwjKKjpaaVqMBuw8eaq2avlWK4r7vWZqqoZZaWv3A%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mj-harris-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html>&#171;&nbsp;MJ Harris - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a>
